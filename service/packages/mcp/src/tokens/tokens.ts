// block) and plain CSS custom properties (:root), which is why token_map's first cut targets those
// two. Tailwind v3's JS config (theme.colors etc.) needs evaluating/AST-parsing JS and is deferred.
// For v4, the @theme namespaces (--color-*, --spacing-*, …) map to utility base names, so the join
// can suggest `primary-500` (a Tailwind utility) and not just the raw custom property.
//
// Delimiting the declarations is `css-scan.ts`; everything here is the token-level meaning built on
// top of them — the Tailwind namespace derivation, and which block's value leads for a given name.

/**
 * How a project token can be referenced in generated code. Which forms exist is a property of the
 * _source_, not of the individual token:
 *
 * - Every CSS source (Tailwind v4 `@theme`, plain `:root` custom properties) declares a custom
 *   property, so `cssVar` is always there; `utility` is derived from the name's namespace when it
 *   has one.
 * - A Tailwind v3 or UnoCSS JS config declares no custom property at all — both inline theme values
 *   into the utilities they generate — so those tokens are utility-only.
 * - A SCSS variable is neither. `$color-primary-500` is the reference, but it only _resolves_ once
 *   the consuming file has pulled the declaring file in, and modern Sass namespaces that: under a
 *   plain `@use './tokens'` the bare `$color-primary-500` is an undefined-variable error and the
 *   reference is `tokens.$color-primary-500`. Verified against dart-sass, not assumed. So a SCSS
 *   token carries the file that declares it and the caller must emit an `@use` for it — the same
 *   shape as `icon_map`, which returns an svg's path rather than fabricating an import specifier.
 *
 * Modelled as a union rather than independent optionals so that {@linkcode refOf} is total by
 * construction: a token with no reference form is not representable, and the compiler proves it.
 * Reaching for `token.name` as a last-resort ref would be exactly the failure this guards — a bare
 * name is not a usable literal in any styling system.
