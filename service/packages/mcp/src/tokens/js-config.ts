// Design tokens read statically out of a utility-framework JS/TS config — `tailwind.config.*` and
// `uno.config.*` / `unocss.config.*`.
//
// Why this exists: both frameworks can keep their scales in a JS object rather than in CSS, and
// `parseCssCustomProperties` — the only project-token source before this — finds nothing there. A
// Tailwind v3 project and any UnoCSS project therefore joined against an empty pool. (Tailwind v4
// moved the same scales into `@theme` custom properties, which is why the CSS path covers it.)
//
// Why static AST and not `import()`: this runs inside an MCP server that an agent can point at any
// directory, so evaluating a stranger's config would execute their code — and a `.ts` config would
// need a loader on top. Reading the object literal costs coverage (a config that computes its theme
// is partly unreadable), never correctness: anything that can't be evaluated by looking at it is
// skipped and counted, never guessed. Same robustness rule as `css-scan.ts` — this reads *other
// people's* repositories, so a malformed or exotic config must degrade, not throw.
//
// Output is deliberately one vocabulary, the one Tailwind v4's `@theme` uses: a v3
// `theme.colors.primary[500]`, a v4 `--color-primary-500` and a UnoCSS `theme.colors.primary[500]`
// all become name `color-primary-500` / utility `primary-500` / category `color`. The join, the
// synonym tables and the built-in-scale fallback needed no knowledge of any of them.
//
// What differs between frameworks is only *which theme key holds which scale*, so that is the sole
// thing the tables below encode. The three vocabularies were each verified by generating CSS from a
// real installed framework rather than read off documentation — see the scale tables for what that
// turned up, notably that UnoCSS is two vocabularies, not one.
//
// These tokens have no CSS custom property — both frameworks inline theme values into the utilities
// they generate — which is why `ProjectToken` models its reference forms as a union: utility-only.
