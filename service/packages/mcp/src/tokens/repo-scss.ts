// The token join's right-hand side for a SCSS project, which until now read nothing at all: `scss`
// has been a detected styling system since before the join existed, but every token source was CSS,
// so such a project joined against an empty pool.
//
// Aggregated rather than pointed at one file, for the same reason the CSS pool is: there is no
// reliable marker for *the* variables file. Real projects range from Bootstrap's single 952-entry
// `_variables.scss` to Vuetify's ~90 per-component ones, and the join filters the pool anyway — a
// Figma variable only surfaces a candidate when name or value agrees, so a component-local
// `$alert-padding` sits unmatched and never reaches the output.
//
// Both kinds of declaration in a `.scss` file count, because modern SCSS projects routinely use
// both and reading only one would leave half of them still joining against nothing:
//
//   - `$name: value` — a Sass variable. Its reference needs an `@use` of the declaring file, so the
//     token carries `from`; see `ProjectToken`'s ref union.
//   - `:root { --name: value }` — a real CSS custom property that happens to be written in a `.scss`
//     file. It compiles through untouched, so `var(--name)` resolves with no import at all, and it
//     is the ordinary CSS arm of that union.
