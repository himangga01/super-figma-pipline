// A lexical scanner for CSS custom-property declarations — not a CSS parser.
//
// It never interprets selector syntax, at-rule semantics, or value grammar. It tracks exactly three
// things: whether the cursor sits inside a comment, inside a string, and how deep it is in braces.
// That is the minimum needed to answer "which block does this `--name: value` belong to", and it is
// precisely what a regex cannot know.
//
// The regex this replaces (`/--([a-zA-Z0-9-]+)\s*:\s*([^;]+);/g` over comment-stripped text) failed
// in two ways that a differential test against postcss over 401 real stylesheets made concrete:
//
//   1. `[^;]+;` requires a terminating semicolon, so the last declaration of a block — which in
//      minified CSS never has one — swallowed the `}` and everything up to the next `;`. Real
//      example from @picocss/pico: `--pico-font-size` parsed as
//      `106.25%}}@media (min-width:768px){:host,:root{--pico-font-size:112.5%}}@media (min-width:1…`
//      rather than `100%`. 1,619 declarations were corrupted this way.
//   2. Comment stripping by regex ate real content: `url("http://x/*y*/z.png")` became
//      `url("http://xz.png")`, because `/*` inside a string is not a comment.
//
// Robustness rule for everything below: this reads *other people's* repositories, so malformed CSS
// must degrade, never throw. Unterminated strings and comments run to end-of-input and the scan
// returns what it collected. postcss raises `unclosed string` here; failing the whole grounding call
// because one vendored stylesheet is truncated would be strictly worse than reading the rest.
