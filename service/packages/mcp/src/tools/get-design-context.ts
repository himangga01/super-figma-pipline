    'Get a depth-limited, token-efficient node tree — the main design-grounding read; prefer it ' +
    'over get_document / get_node for anything large. Starts from nodeId (a pasted Figma URL also ' +
    'works), else the current selection; errors when neither is available. ' +
    'detail: minimal (id/name/type) / compact (+ geometry) / full (+ styling, layout, text and ' +
    'design-system tokens resolved to names plus a deduped globalVars style table). Defaults to ' +
    'full with dedupeComponents true — the code-generation view; pass detail: compact explicitly ' +
    'for a cheap structure scan. An over-budget full result degrades gracefully, always with a ' +
    'leading note saying which shape you got: a small overshoot returns the same tree with LAYOUT ' +
    'intact and only appearance dropped (every frame keeps its flex/grid mode, padding, gap and ' +
    'alignment, each node its sizing/constraints, each text its characters — enough to build ' +
    'correct containers, then re-ground per section for colour and type); anything bigger returns ' +
    'a sectionPlan, which is the BEST outcome and not the worst — each section grounded on its own ' +
    'comes back at full detail with layout AND colour AND type. Layout-only and geometry-only ' +
    'views appear only for a subtree with nothing left to split into. Whatever shape comes back, ' +
    "build layout from each frame's own layout object — never reconstruct spacing from child x/y " +
    'as margins or absolute offsets. ' +
    'depth limits child levels (omit or 0 = unlimited; cut nodes are ' +
    'flagged truncated). dedupeComponents collapses repeated instances of an already-expanded main ' +
    'component (flagged deduped); a deduped instance still carries textOverrides ({ name, ' +
    'characters } — the visible text it actually renders) and propertyOverrides (its per-instance ' +
    'visual diffs), so per-instance content survives without re-expanding the collapsed subtree. ' +
    'A tree too large to return whole comes back as a sectionPlan instead ({ sections: [{ nodeId, ' +
    'name, nodes, … }] } + a note): do not retry unscoped — call again per section nodeId at ' +
    'detail full and build section by section. On a full result, raw color values that exactly ' +
    "equal a project design token are annotated in projectTokens ({ '#6266F0': { ref, name, " +
    "matchedBy: ['value'] } }, or { matchedBy, candidates: [...] } when several tokens share the " +
    'value). An entry carrying `from` is a SCSS variable whose ref does NOT resolve on its own — ' +
    'the file you write must @use it first, and `from` is REPO-relative while Sass resolves @use ' +
    'against the importing file, so re-resolve it from where you are writing ' +
    "(src/components/x.scss imports '../styles/tokens'). `as *` keeps the ref as given, a " +
    'namespaced @use requires prefixing it; emitting the ref without the import is a compile error. ' +
    "matchedBy: ['value'] marks every entry as name-blind value-equality evidence — a " +
    'hypothesis to verify, not a resolved binding: emit the ref only when the token fits the ' +
    'context semantically, keep the raw value otherwise, and let a bound Figma variable win over ' +
    'a raw-value match.',
