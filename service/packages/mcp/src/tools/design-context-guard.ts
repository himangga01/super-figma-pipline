// The public-path guard around get_design_context, the hot grounding read. Internal consumers
// (design_diff snapshots, component/icon map walks) dispatch the tool directly and are untouched;
// this wrapper only runs for the MCP tool call, where the result lands in an LLM context.
//
// The public call defaults to the CODE-GENERATION view — detail 'full' + dedupeComponents true —
// because the default caller is someone turning a design into code, and a compact default made
// exactly that caller eyeball styling off a screenshot (the classic accuracy failure). Structure
// scans stay one explicit `detail: 'compact'` away. From there the result degrades in a cascade,
// each step only firing where the previous shape could not be delivered:
//
//   full fits the budget                     → full (the accurate default)
//   full over budget, layout+content fits    → LAYOUT + text/props projection + note
//   still over, tree splits into sections    → section plan (ground each section at FULL)
//   unsplittable, layout alone fits          → LAYOUT projection (text/props dropped) + note
//   unsplittable, only geometry fits         → compact projection (geometry only) + note
//   nothing fits and nothing to split        → the payload as-is (a plan would strand the caller)
//   tree too large to even serialize (bail)  → section plan straight from the plugin, pre-work
//
// The plugin's pre-serialization bail is armed with budget: true (the coarse net); the mcp-side
// token budget is the precise net (see DESIGN_CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET for the measurements behind it)
// — beyond it the result errors out and delivers nothing, so every downgrade replaces a dead end,
// never a working result.
//
// Section plan BEFORE the smaller projections is the important ordering. A section plan is not a
// lesser result: each section, grounded on its own, comes back at FULL detail with its layout AND
// its colour, type and tokens — strictly more than any whole-tree projection that had to drop half
// its fields to fit. The projections exist for the trees a plan cannot help: a single deep subtree
// with nothing to split into. Putting geometry-only ahead of the plan is what made the tool hand
// back a coordinate dump that looked usable and was not.
//
// The LAYOUT tier exists because the cascade used to jump straight from full to geometry-only, and
// geometry-only is precisely the input that makes a model emit absolute offsets and per-child
// margins instead of the container's own flex/grid, padding and gap — the design's structure
// survives in the tree but its layout system does not (issue #161). That jump also threw away far
// more than the budget required: measured on real over-budget sections, full ran 153k–158k chars
// while the same tree keeping every layout field ran 87k–96k — comfortably inside the budget the
// old downgrade was shedding styling to reach. So the tier keeps what defines the BOX MODEL and the
// FLOW (and what the element says) and drops only APPEARANCE — colours, typography, effects, token
// bindings — which is the half a caller can re-ground per section, and the half that is expensive.
// When even the layout tier does not fit, sectioning takes over; the layout-only and geometry-only
// rungs remain for unsplittable trees, and there text/props are shed before layout — letting the
// ~15% that text costs push a result off the layout rung would trade the whole box model for some
// strings.
