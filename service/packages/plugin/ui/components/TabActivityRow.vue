    <!-- The row is a container, not a control: the expand toggle and the reveal button have to be
         siblings, since a button can't legally nest inside another one. That split leaves gaps
         belonging to no child — the `gap-2` between the two icons, this element's own padding — and
         the whole row lights up on hover, so those gaps read as clickable and aren't. Toggling here
         too closes them: clicks that reached a child have already been handled, and Reveal stops
         its own from bubbling, so this only ever fires for the space between them. The keyboard
         path is unaffected — this is a div, and the real button inside still carries the semantics
         and the tab stop. -->
