// A subset of Figma's VariableResolvedDataType, which plugin-typings 1.133 widened with EASING and
// TIMING. Those two are deliberately left out: Figma's own createVariable refuses them —
// "EASING and TIMING variable creation is not currently available" — measured 2026-08-08 against an
// up-to-date editor, so offering them would only be a guaranteed failure.
//
// The whole write side is gated, not just creation: setValueForMode likewise answers "EASING
// variable editing is not supported". Such variables *can* be made in the Figma UI and read back
// fine (get-variable-defs serializes their curves), so plugins see them as read-only for now.
// Re-add both here and in the MCP tool's enum once Figma opens writing up.
