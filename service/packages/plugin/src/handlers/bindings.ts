// Figma will happily accept a binding embedded in a plain object literal — that is the only way to
// bind a gradient stop, which has no setter — but measured against a live file, that path validates
// almost nothing: an id matching no variable, and a variable of the wrong resolved type, are both
// taken without complaint and then render as white. So bindings go through the official
// `setBoundVariableFor*` setters wherever one exists, which reject both, and the one case with no
// setter (a gradient stop) is checked here instead.
//
// Each function resolves every id first and only then builds the result, so a bad id throws before
// anything reaches the document rather than leaving a half-written node or a half-built style.

 * one no mode will ever resolve (a family from one mode paired with a style from another), and

 * surfaces from `setBoundVariable`, naming the exact face — a better error than one this could
